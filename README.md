# Inverse-Kinematics-Unity3d
A simple Sample of Standing shooting commando game project using inverse Kinematic of Unit3d 5.5.2

The sample contains just Aiming by using Inverse Kinematics, it does not have moving controls.

I took Background images from Internet and rest of UI is Unity3d default button, sorry for my bad aesthetic sense.

It also Mobile touch controls for Mobile build

It has 3 scenes. 1) Main Menu 2) Enemy Rushing 3) enemy Helicopter Attack.

You can adjust the threshold of aiming by adjusting the poistion of cube call "Load" in the scene.

The wrote the code as simple as possible.

The sample also is android Mobile Ready. Android APK is also added in master copy.

I am looking forward if some one has queries.
